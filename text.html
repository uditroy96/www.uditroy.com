	<p><b><i>Hello everyone,<br>

It's a great pleasure to introduce my self.<br>

I'm Udit  and I'm a Website designer as well as a trained data entry operator.<br>

 I love testing websites, mobile sites and apps, in order to help make sure 
 they are the best quality possible.<br>

 
 I also have a skill in Photo editing , Designing Dynamic Graphics ,Voice 
 recording as well as mixing  &  also have much concept about musics.<br>

I specifically enjoy working alongside developers and designers, learning from them, and sharing my experience and of course the issues I've found when testing.<br>

I'm here to keep abreast of web design trends, continue learning about how sites are designed or developed so that I can understand the best approaches to test them.<br>


I'm also interested in particular problem areas that web designers and developers are confronted with and maybe I can share a few things that I know.<br>

Thatâ€™s all about myself  and  Thank you so much.</i></b><br><br>
